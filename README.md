# Eigenvalue distribution from bootstrap estimates

This repository contains supplementary material for the paper **"Eigenvalue distribution from bootstrap estimates"** (to appear in *Physical Review D*) (autors: Samuel Kováčik, Katarína Magdolenová).

## Overview

The bootstrap method has proven useful for analyzing a wide range of matrix models.  
In this work, we demonstrate how the computed moments can be used to reconstruct the underlying eigenvalue probability distribution.  
This reconstruction allows for the evaluation of the model’s **free energy** — a crucial quantity for identifying the thermodynamically preferred solution.

We verify the approach on the well-studied **quartic potential model** and further apply it to a recently analyzed **asymmetric multi-trace (cubic) model**.  
By exploring an extended class of possible solutions, we show that free-energy analysis consistently identifies the correct physical branch, making it a powerful tool for studying models with complex solution structures.

## Contents

It includes selected sets of moments for the **quartic** and **cubic asymmetric models**.  
It also contains several computed values of the **free energy**, showing how the free-energy value changes when varying the **interval** used to normalize the initial distribution and the parameter **M**.  
Finally, it provides **additional figures** not included in the paper, illustrating how, for given values of **r** and **g**, the one-cut asymmetric solutions transition into two-cut configurations.
